# dawa

The goal of dawa is to make it easy to get danish address data. The package is in danish since the entire official documentation is in danish and the parameters used in the API calls are danish as well.

## To do

Write tests     
Write a vignette     
Upload to CRAN     

## Installation

You can install dawa from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikkelkrogsholm/dawa")
```
